    <h1>MEXICO</h1>
    <img src="mexico1.jpg">
    <p>It's been a long time that I want to travel around this country. This winter I plan to go in Mexico with my mother </p>
    <h2>GENERAL FEATURES</h2>
    <h3>SITUATION</h3>
    <p>The surface area is 2 million km2. The capital is Mexico City. Mexico has a long border with the United States (to the north) and Guatemala and Brazil (to the south). It faces the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean
      Sea to the east. Between the two oceans, Mexico is crossed by two large mountain ranges, both called LA SIERRE MADRE. The highest point is the peak of Orizaba, with 5700m. It is generally colder in the north and warmer in the south. There are only
      2 seasons: the dry season from November to May and the rainy season from June to October.
    </p>
    <h3>FLAG</h3>
    <img src="mexico2.jpg">
    <p>This flag consists of three vertical stripes of equal width and the colours green (on the side of the flag pole), white and red.
      <ul>
        <li>Green means hope, joy and love</li>
        <li>White represents peace and honesty</li>
        <li>Red represents rusticity, bravery, strength and courage</li>
      </ul>
      The coat of arms of Mexico appears in the centre of the white band. It is an eagle with a snake in its beak perched on a cactus. The central coat of arms is derived from a legend that the Aztecs originally wandered in search of a place to settle, which
      would be indicated by an eagle on a cactus eating a snake; they saw this sign and founded their capital, Tenochtitlan, which is now Mexico City.
    </p>
    <h3>LANGUAGES</h3>
    <img src="mexico3.png">
    <p>According to official data, there are 69 official languages in Mexico: 68 indigenous languages and Spanish. There are about fifty indigenous languages spoken, unfortunately about forty are about to disappear because there are very few speakers left.
      English is also spoken in some public places in large cities, but it is not widespread. French is spoken in Mexican high society due to the historical rapprochement between France and Mexico. Mexican is not really a language since the first official
      language is Castilian Spanish. It is exactly the same language as in Spain. Some words and expressions may differ, but these differences can be compared to Canadian French with French from France.
    </p>
    <h2>CURRENT SITUATION</h2>
    <h3>POLICY</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><img src=""></li>
      <!-- Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador-->
      <li><img src=""></li>
      <!-- Marcelo Ebrard -->
    </ul>
    <p>Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected President of the Republic by direct universal suffrage. His term of office began on 1 December 2018 for 6 years, non-renewable. Last year, Mexico elected a left-wing president and joined several other governments of the same political colour in Latin America. Mexico has granted political asylum to resigning Bolivian President Evo Morales, announced Mexican diplomat Marcelo Ebrard. Mexico City believes that Evo Morales, who announced his resignation on Sunday, was the victim of a coup d'état. Marcelo Ebrard assured that Evo Morales' life was threatened and that the decision to grant him asylum was part of a long Mexican tradition of welcoming political exiles. Following the collapse of his government on Sunday, Evo Morales said that "violent groups" had attacked his home. No information has been given on the whereabouts of the resigning head of state, even though he is believed to have flown on the presidential plane to his stronghold in Chapare province. At the same time, Bolivia plunged into chaos in the hours following Evo Morales' resignation, while the Bolivian army came to support the police in dealing with acts of "vandalism". Thousands of supporters of the socialist leader have left El Alto, a town near the capital La Paz, to reach the seat of the Assembly, raising fears of clashes with police forces and opposition supporters. Evo Morales repeated that he was the victim of a conspiracy fomented by Carlos Mesa, his main rival in the October 20 presidential election.</p>
    <h3>ECONOMY</h3>
    <p>This country is the largest economy in Latin America, ahead of Brazil. The capital, Mexico City alone, accounts for nearly 50% of the country's economic activity. It is the 2nd largest city in the world after Tokyo. In 2019, according to IMF estimates, Mexican GDP reached $1,241 billion (+1.5% - compared to $1,223 billion in 2018). This progress has earned the country 15th place in the ranking of the richest nations. The world production of avocados represents 161 kilos per second or 5.1 million tonnes per year. Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados, followed by the Dominican Republic and Peru. It produces more than 30% of the world's production.</p>
    <h3>FOCUS ON... TOURISM</h3>
    <p>Mexico is the 8th most visited country in the world and the first tourist destination in Latin America; in 2012, the country received 23.4 million tourists, the sector generating an income of $12.7 billion. Tourism is the country's 4th largest source
      of income, activity represents 8.4% of GDP and generates 2.5 million direct jobs and 5 million indirect jobs. The country is the main tourist destination for the United States. Americans are the main tourists travelling to Mexico (70%). In August
      2012, Mexico was awarded the prize for the best tourism promotion institution for the quality of its promotion strategies, market diversification, advertising campaigns and its relations with the main international travel agencies. Mexico aims to
      be the 5th most popular tourist destination in the world by 2018. The country hopes to capture $40 billion through tourism and create 4 million direct jobs and 12 million indirect jobs. According to the latest satisfaction survey of international
      tourists, Mexico stands out for:
      <ul>
        <li>Its reputation index: 98%.</li>
        <li>Its recommendation index: 99%.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>MUST-SEE PLACES</h3>
  <h4>THE TWO VOLCANOES, POPOCATEPETL AND IXTACCIHUATL</h4>
  <p>The story goes that a warrior who wanted to marry a princess had to bring back the head of an opposing tribal chief in order to marry the princess. When the warrior returned victorious with the loser's head, he found the princess lying dead. The warrior knelt down and history says that the shape of his two volcanoes seen from the sky would be the shape of a kneeling man and the other the shape of a lying woman.</p>
  <h4>COBA</h4>
  <p>An important archaeological site belonging to the Mayan civilization. It is located in the Yucatán peninsula, in southeastern Mexico.
    </p>
  <h4>THE NATIONAL PALACE</h4>
  <p>The seat of the federal executive power in Mexico. It is located in Mexico City's main square, Constitution Square.
    </p>
  <h4>THE KUKULCAN PYRAMID</h4>
  <p>Also known as El Castillo, it is a pre-Columbian monument, more than a thousand years old, built by the Mayans.
    </p>
    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>In this presentation of Mexico, reference is made to the Mayan temples which are absolutely superb, but the beaches of Tulum are equally famous. Indeed, they are white sandy beaches as far as the eye can see for more than 5 kilometres. There is one particular beach I would really like to go to: Gran Cenote.</p>
  <img src="">
  <p>It is not strictly speaking a beach, but the Gran Cenote de Tulum is just as important. It should be noted that in the province of Yucatan, there are no less than 6000 cenotes, including 1000 in Tulum. These open-air caves have crystal clear water, with fish, small turtles, and allow you to dive or snorkel to explore the wonders of the seabed.

  <!-- <div> I have decided to tell you about my past trips but especially about my future trip. I have travelled a lot in recent years, I have travelled to almost all European capitals, I have lived a lot of time in Southern Africa and South Africa. But now I want to go to South America and mainly to Bolivia. In the centre of Latin America, Bolivia offers incredible diversity with breathtaking cultural richness. -->
